# Interactive Background Effect

This project creates an interactive background effect where elements are dynamically generated and removed based on user input, either mouse movement or touch interaction.

## Features

- Generates `span` elements at the cursor/touch position
- Works with both mouse and touch input
- Elements have random sizes
- Elements fade out and are removed after 3 seconds

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

### Mouse Input
Move your mouse around the screen. `span` elements will be created following your cursor's path.

### Touch Input
On touch-enabled devices, move your finger across the screen. `span` elements will be created following your finger's path.

## Code Overview

The main JavaScript file consists of the following key components:

1. `createSpan(x, y)`: A function that creates and appends a `span` element at the given x and y coordinates. It also sets a random size for the element and removes it after 3 seconds.

2. Mouse event listener: Listens for the `mousemove` event and calls `createSpan()` with the current mouse coordinates.

3. Touch event listener: Listens for the `touchmove` event and calls `createSpan()` with the current touch coordinates.

## Customization

You can customize this project by:

- Changing the element type (currently `span`)
- Modifying the size range (currently random between 0 and 100 pixels)
- Adjusting the lifespan of elements (currently 3000ms)
- Styling the elements in CSS (e.g., background-color, border-radius, etc.)

## Notes

- The `touchmove` event's default behavior (scrolling) is prevented. This might not be desirable in all cases, especially if your page needs to scroll.
- On touch devices, many elements may be created quickly as `touchmove` fires continuously. Consider throttling this for performance.
